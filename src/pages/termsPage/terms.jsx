      <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
      <h2>Binding Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        If any dispute, controversy or claim arises under this Agreement or in relation to any
        Service or the Rahee Platform, including any question regarding the existence, validity or
        termination of this Agreement or T&Cs (hereinafter Dispute), the parties shall use all
        reasonable endeavours to resolve such Dispute amicably. If the parties are unable to resolve
        the Dispute amicably within 30 days of the notice of such Dispute, Rahee may elect to
        resolve any Dispute by a binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Indian
        Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter Act). Such Dispute shall be arbitrated
        on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or
        controversy of any other party. The Dispute shall be resolved by a sole arbitrator,
        appointed in accordance with the Act. The seat of the arbitration shall be
        Delhi and the language of this arbitration shall be English. Either You or
        RAAHEE may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction
        in Delhi necessary to protect the rights or the property belonging to You or Rahee (or any of
        our agents, suppliers, and subcontractors), pending the completion of arbitration. Any
        arbitration shall be confidential, and neither You nor Rahee may disclose the existence,
        content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of
        enforcing the arbitration award. All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be
        divided equally between You and Rahee. In all arbitrations, each party will bear the expense
        of its own lawyers and preparation. This paragraph shall survive the termination of this
        Agreement.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
        individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
        <li>
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and
        </li>
        <li> there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported</li>

        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
        concerning binding arbitration:
      </p>

      <ol>

          intellectual property rights of a Party;

          privacy, or unauthorized use; and
        </li>
        <li>
          any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
          unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
          portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall
          be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
          jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
          court.

        These Terms and Conditions and any policies or operating rules posted by Rahee on the
        Website/Mobile Application or in respect to the Website/Mobile Application constitute the
        entire agreement and understanding between you and RAAHEE. Our failure to exercise or
        enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not operate as a waiver
        of such right or provision. These Terms and Conditions operate to the fullest extent
        permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
        time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
        caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision
        of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
        provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and
        does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
        venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
        result of these Terms and Conditions or use of the Website/Mobile Application. You agree
        that these Terms and Conditions will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted
        them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of
        these Terms and Conditions and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these
        Terms and Conditions.
