              Emotional hygiene is being mindful of our psychological or mental health and adopting brief daily
              habits to monitor and address psychological wounds when we sustain them. For example, when we
              get a wound, we are taught that we must disinfect and treat it so that it will heal, likewise if we are
              devastated or wounded mentally or emotionally, we should treat it well.

                  The workshop conducted by the team rahee was absolutely down
                  to earth and relatable. Their presentation had so many
                  interactive and cool animations. The activity conducted by
                  them helped us connect to our emotions which I believe in
                  needed in the times that we are living in. It was a job well
                  done.

                  A very interactive and interesting workshop with amazing
                  animations and activities. It was great seeing all the
                  positive replies from other Raahees on the website. I have
                  used the website a few times recently too and the replies are
                  always better than the last time. Thankyou team Raahee for
                  taking this initiative. You have all done a wonderful job.

                  Raahee is curated with souls who are doing a fantastic work in
                  a world full of selfishness. I personally have been going
                  through mental complications lately and did attend few
                  workshops too but 'Raahee Buddy' gave me some hope. I really
                  loved the concept of creating an online support group and
                  enjoyed the workshop throughout. Starting from conversation
                  then the activity and uptil the chat. I am very sure Raahee
                  will be hope and will be change for people who are looking for
                  support.
